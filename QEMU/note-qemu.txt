Before building qemu, we will first need to install 'libslirp' package and add "--enable-slirp" to the qemu build file before compiling qemu.

By building and installing libslirp first and building it with qemu, it will allow us to have network in qemu or else we will get this error.

"-nic user: network backend 'user' is not ompiled into this binary" 

Because the network commandline is "-nic user,hostfwd=tcp::5555-:22"
